## 🧠 Overview  

**3D Stretch of Solids** is a practical extension created to enhance direct manipulation of solid models. It enables designers to reshape existing geometry by extending or shifting faces and edges in true 3D space, without restarting the modeling process.

This approach is especially valuable when working with mature designs that require dimensional updates or structural tweaks. Instead of reconstructing features, users can make controlled adjustments while keeping the original form intact.

Designed for integration into professional CAD environments, the tool prioritizes accuracy, speed, and consistency when editing complex solid objects.
